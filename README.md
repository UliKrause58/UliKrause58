- 👋 Hi, I’m @UliKrause58 and a newcomer on home assistant
- 👀 I’m interested in connection opendtu on an esp32 with home assistant, using mqtt und mosquitto for energy-management.
-    My ahoy-dtu on esp8266 arduino d1 works fine but it doesn't support mqtt with two solar-hoymiles-inverter.
-    The integrtion of my solar SMA-Tripower, our Weishaupt heatpump and AC-THOR controller was successfull and works fine
-    I'm struggeling with the SunnyHome Manager 2.0 to receive the current load and upload into the grid.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automations with lights and sockets and controlling in yaml-files
-     I would like to learn more about templates, helpers and how to use them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not at the moment
- 📫 How to reach me uli.r.krause@googlemail.com
